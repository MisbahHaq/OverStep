      <p class="card-text">
        Founded by two friends with a shared vision, Verve Step began as an idea to harness our potential and showcase
        what we could achieve together. Today, it’s a growing agency that brings bold concepts to life through
        cutting-edge web design and development. Our story started with a simple goal: to create websites that don’t
        just look great but also deliver outstanding functionality and user experiences. Every website we build reflects
        our commitment to quality, attention to detail, and the belief that every client’s story deserves to be told
        uniquely.
        <br /><br />
        At Over Step, freelancing isn’t just a job; it’s our craft. We thrive on collaborating with clients to
        understand their needs, bringing their ideas to life with precision and creativity. Whether it’s a sleek
        portfolio, a dynamic e-commerce site, or a complex web application, we’re here to make it happen.
